  <h1>🧠 Why Learning C is Still Important in 2025</h1>

  <p>The C programming language has been around for over 50 years, yet it's still one of the most powerful and widely-used languages in the world. From system programming to embedded devices and compilers, C remains a foundational skill for every serious programmer.</p>

  <h2>🔧 Control & Performance</h2>
  <p>C gives you direct access to memory using pointers, manual memory management, and fine-grained control over how your program runs. This makes it a favorite in high-performance applications and system-level software.</p>

  <h2>📦 Base for Other Languages</h2>
  <p>Languages like C++, Java, Python, and Go are heavily influenced by C. Learning C makes it easier to understand how these languages work under the hood.</p>

  <h2>🚀 Career & Competitive Coding</h2>
  <p>Many tech interviews and competitive programming contests use C (or C++). Understanding how data structures and memory work in C can give you an edge.</p>

  <h2>🎓 Embedded Systems & OS Development</h2>
  <p>All major operating systems — Linux, Windows, and macOS — have components written in C. It's the language of choice for embedded systems and microcontrollers too.</p>
